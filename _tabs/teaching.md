### Teaching Philosophy

Teaching is one of my favorite parts of academic life — I love helping students build intuition around complex Earth systems. My approach to teaching emphasizes curiosity, real-world relevance, and active engagement. I aim to create an inclusive, supportive learning environment where students feel confident asking questions and exploring ideas.

It was a pleasure getting to have her as ourTA, and she will go far with the passion that is based in her teaching. Each lab she certainly did her best to communicate effectively,and work with students' learning types.”

While working in the laboratory, she provides clear and concise instruction and even demonstrates experiments for us in a fascinating and informative manner. The best part about her is that she is quite approachable and will always help you understand the content and subject matter.”

        “This discussion section was a rock this entire semester! With other classes feeling unimportant and irrelevant to the world around us, our discussions were always engaging and super pertinent to what we are all experiencing outside of the classroom. It was a super safe and encouraging learning environment.”

        “Brianna did an absolutely phenomenal job of guiding the discussion. She really proposed ideas which made us rethink the way that disaster mitigation, the government, and even science in general are structured. I like that we were able to submit our own discussion questions because it enabled me to think really critically of the texts before class. The amount of reading each week was very manageable, but extremely effective at giving us the proper background information to contribute to the discussion. The breakout rooms were my favorite part of class because I was able to connect with other students and chat with them in a way that felt very casual and comfortable. Brianna was also very considerate of our mental health during this extremely chaotic time, which is greatly appreciated and allowed us to engage with the course material without too much stress. I am really happy to have taken this class and know that it has changed my perspective in many ways."
