Teaching is one of my favorite parts of academic life — I love helping students build intuition around complex Earth systems.

### Courses I've Taught or TA'd:

- **CORE 103: Processes of Change in Science** - University of Southern California
  Focus: Social and economic impacts of natural hazards; power and limitations of science to improve our lives through the
worldview of geophysics; interplay of media, government and lobbyists with hazard response.

- **GEOL 240: Earthquakes** – University of Southern California  
  Focus: Causes of earthquakes and nature of large faults; earthquake hazard and risk; world's great earthquakes; understanding the Richter scale.

- **GEOL 160: Introduction to Geosystems** – University of Southern California
  Focus: Survey of natural geological/ environmental processes (systems) and variability active near the earth's surface in the region that houses most life (the biosphere).

- **GEOL 107: Oceanography** – University of Southern California
  Focus: Physical, chemical, and geological character of the oceans andocean basins; ocean processes and agents; economic value of the oceans.

### Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching emphasizes curiosity, real-world relevance, and active engagement. I aim to create an inclusive, supportive learning environment where students feel confident asking questions and exploring ideas.
