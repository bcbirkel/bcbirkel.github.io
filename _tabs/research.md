My research centers on understanding how **local geology and basin structure** impact seismic wave behavior â€” especially in tectonically active regions like Southern California.

I'm currently working on:

- Modeling site amplification in the Los Angeles Basin
- Using polarization analysis to characterize wave types and directions
- Investigating frequency-dependent effects of basin structure on seismic response

I use a combination of Python-based analysis tools, numerical simulation, and observational datasets. I'm especially interested in how improved understanding of local site effects can contribute to more accurate hazard assessments.
