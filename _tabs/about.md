Hi! I'm **Brianna Birkel**, a PhD student in Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California.

My research focuses on **seismic wave amplification in the Los Angeles Basin**, combining observational data, numerical modeling, and geophysical analysis. I'm passionate about understanding how complex subsurface structures affect ground motion â€” and by extension, seismic hazard.

When I'm not debugging code or analyzing seismic data, you might find me at my local pottery studio, swimming, or hanging out at the beach with my dog.

If you'd like to learn more, feel free to check out my [CV](/cv/), [Research](/research/), or [Teaching](/teaching/) pages!
