Hi! I'm Brianna Birkel, a Ph.D. candidate in Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California. My research focuses on seismic wave amplification in the Los Angeles Basin, using observational data, numerical modeling, and geophysical analysis to understand how complex subsurface structures affect ground motion and seismic hazard.

My work combines geophysics, seismology, and computational methods, and often involves collaboration with researchers spanning multiple disciplines, from geology to civil engineering. In addition to my research, I am also passionate about teaching and enjoy finding ways to make complex concepts clear and engaging for students.
